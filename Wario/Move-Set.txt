PROPERTIES
-MAX Super

==========
SUPER FART
==========
This move works just like his down B in Super Smash Bros. If he hits his opponent, or gets hit by his opponent, then he
slowly charges his Fart Meter. You can perform the super fart any time you want, but the meter you've built up to that
point dictates the strength of the fart, with the weakest dealing no damage at all, to the strongest dealing 50% damage.
If you perform the super fart, the entire fart meter will be gone. Once you have reached the maximum amount of meter, 
Wario will flash brown like he did in Smash.

The fart meter can't be seen normally, but by double tapping down, you are able to view your meter, and by tapping down
twice once more, the meter disappears.

Move: Super Fart
Command: D, D, D, P
